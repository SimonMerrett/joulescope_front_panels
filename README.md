# Joulescope Front Panels

Welcome to Joulescopeâ„¢ front panel hardware design project.  This project 
contains the open source hardware designs for a variety of Joulescope front
panels.  These front panels customize Joulescope so that it can more easily 
connect to your power supply and target device.
