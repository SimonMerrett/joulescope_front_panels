# Joulescope Front Panels

Welcome to Joulescopeâ„¢ front panel hardware design project.  This project 
contains the open source hardware designs for a variety of Joulescope front
panels.  These front panels customize Joulescope so that it can more easily 
connect to your power supply and target device.
For more information on Joulescope, see

As of Mar 2019, all designs were done in Autodesk Eagle PCB.

The [Baseline PDF](fp_baseline.pdf) show the board outline and critical 
dimensions.

The boards have been fabricated using PCBWay.
